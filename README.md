# docker-baseimage-alpine

__________

An Alpine base image with zsh, git, jq, fzf and s6 overlay.

Based on [LinuxServer.io's Docker Alpine Linux base image](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-baseimage-alpine), with elements I use in my images. Added [s6-overlay from Just-Containers](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay/) which helps with creating and managing services.

_TO-DO: Add a better README.md_
